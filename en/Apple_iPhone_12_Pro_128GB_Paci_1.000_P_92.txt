Love the phone. Been wanting it since it came out and finally put some money together to buy it. I do must say I’m happy to be back with iPhone. I was stuck with a Motorola G4 for almost a year and a half and that phone took a beaten and I finally got tired of it lagging and been a bit of an annoyance to navigate. This phone is clean, sturdy, and very well put together. Love the cameras, I blew my friends mind when I showed him it could take pictures in the dark on SELFIE mode. Even for a refurbished phone it still looks brand new, no dings nor scratches. Looked very clean and smooth when I unwrapped it. And yea unwrapped it. Would’ve prefer getting the whole “brand new fresh off the box” experience. But I’m not complaining. They secured it pretty well. Package might not be filled with bubble wrap but this phone is durable. All they needed was to wrap it around with some foam and the phone got to me in one piece, looked brand new. Didn’t even have to squint my eye I swear.
Side note I didn’t put a rating on the finger print because I do not know whether this phone has one. I haven’t bothered the face recognition is enough. It won’t rwcognize your face with a mask on (obviously) but it does recognize from all kinds of angles. Literally even as far as your arms can reach. I’ve gotten myself an Apple Watch lately the 7 specifically and they go hand in hand love them both. I’ve had the phone for 4 months now and it still looks brand new, I still take it out of the case and feel it. I did spent a grand on it, which for a lot of people it is pretty pricy but so far I haven’t had a complain or a regret for buying a thousand dollar phone. Which was a HUGE thing before I bought it. Maybe it’s because I’m finally back with iPhone money doesn’t matter if you’re happy really.
Camera is crisp btw.
