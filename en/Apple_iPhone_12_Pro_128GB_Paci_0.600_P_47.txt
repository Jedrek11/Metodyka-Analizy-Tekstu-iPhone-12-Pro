I bought the iPhone 12 Pro “excellent” condition, while the phone looks barely used, I can’t say the same for the battery, it’s at 77% maximum capacity, mind you, my previous phone which is the iPhone XR has a maximum capacity of 80% and I used it heavily for years, I work in the outdoors and usually have brightness all the way up + in cold and hot conditions and yet it has a higher battery capacity, I’m kinda disappointed and I expected better.
