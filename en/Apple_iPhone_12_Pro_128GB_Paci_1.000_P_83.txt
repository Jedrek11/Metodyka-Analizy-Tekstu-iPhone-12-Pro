The phone is spotless the screen super clean, and the phone looks incredible!! Besides having 85% battery life there’s nothing I can say the phone came in with a charging cable USB type A to lighting port with a wall plug no original box.
Everything checks out there’s 0 problem so for!
Very satisfied with the purchase! Would recommend.
Update Apr 30th,25, almost 3 weeks later the phone stuck in a boot loop and unfortunately, I will have to return it, the phone looked great, and I liked it a lot and for that I'm not going to change the rating as it's an inconvenient thing but not a big of a deal I just got to drop it off at a return center.
