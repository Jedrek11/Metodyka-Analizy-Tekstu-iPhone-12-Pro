On my journey of ordering a refurbished iPhone and it can be a journey this was an excellent purchase. Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly. Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp. Battery Health is 88% and stable. Got same day delivery and up and running quickly. Purchased refurb level was “excellent”. Should have been my first stop..

Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone.

I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.
Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware. So in the return box this goes.

Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens. Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair. So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers. I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts. Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.

Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped. The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up. If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.
