This is an initial review based on no technical knowledge. The phone was bought as a gift and arrived well packaged, and quickly. I have no impulse control, so the phone/package was immediately presented to the recipient and opened. Phone and a new, generic 3 foot cord were in the box. The color, of the phone and on the screen when turned on, is fabulous, just as it should be. The phone itself is in excellent condition.
After it has been thoroughly checked and tested for functionality a new review will be written. For today, quick, superficial assessment - this was a great purchase and I know where my next phone is coming from.
