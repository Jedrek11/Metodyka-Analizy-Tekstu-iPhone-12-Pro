The phone works but it’s not renewed-excellent it’s used.

The battery percentage is 80% and the screen is scratched.

There is nothing renewed about this device; the battery doesn’t hold up for longer long.

The size is okay and I was able to upload the latest iOS easily so it’s compatible. The cost is okay but could be cheaper based on the condition of the phone.
