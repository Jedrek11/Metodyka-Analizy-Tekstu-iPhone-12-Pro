I'm not an Apple guy, but I fell in love with this phone pretty fast. It's got all the external features you could really need, and it's super clean and efficient, which is my favorite thing about iPhones. It was way too expensive, even refurbished, but it functions well, so I'd say it was worth it. It holds a charge relatively well, though you have to be careful not to keep too many apps running at once. I love the squared edge design, and it came in mint condition. You would never know that it was refurbished. The only problems I've had so far are with the cameras, though I think that was my fault, and just the software options, which have nothing to do with the phone itself. Overall, good purchase!
