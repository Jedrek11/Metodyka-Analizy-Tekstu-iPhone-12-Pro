Totally unlock transferred service easily as this was a replacement phone the previous phone needed a new battery but could not be service for because the back was broken and cracked and when it rains it pours not pun intended but She dropped it in the shower and then screen would turn off easily. She transferred ALL 512 GB using the side by side technique. We’ll see how it goes later down the line. Me personally will not be purchasing a phone brand new going forward. Please note that her last phone was a 12 Pro Max so she downgraded in size but she is happy. Thank you to the seller and if things go well I may be upgrading. And oh, it’s pretty too.
