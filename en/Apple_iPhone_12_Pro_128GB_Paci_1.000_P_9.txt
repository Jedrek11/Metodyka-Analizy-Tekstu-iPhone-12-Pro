This is my third purchase of a renewed iPhone from the Amazon Renewed Store. They are such a great value compared to a new phone. My latest purchase looked brand new, and had 96% of its original battery capacity, suggesting that the battery had been replaced in the renewal process since iPhone 12 Pro production stopped 4 years ago. Included in the box were a charging cord (USB C to Fire) and a SIM card tray tool. It took less than 30 minutes to mirror the data and apps from my older iPhone 12 Pro to the new one via WiFi.

I kept my previously-purchased iPhone 12 Pro to use as a mobile hotspot (I live in a rural area without broadband). It is still working fine except that the side button no longer functions after 2 years of daily hard use in my *very* dusty environment (no protective case). There are easy workarounds for the lack of side button (power off with Siri or in Settings; power on by plugging into charger; update or install apps with a change in Settings), but I retired my iPhone 8 hotspot (still working flawlessly after being purchased from the Amazon Renewed Store 6 years ago) because it no longer is supported by the current iOS, making it incompatible with some updated apps that I use heavily (e.g., Substack).

Listen to the Andrew Yang podcast "The Hidden Cost Of Your 'Free' Phone" to get an idea of how much money you save by buying a refurb.
