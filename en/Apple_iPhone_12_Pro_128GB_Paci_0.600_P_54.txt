Here's a review for a refurbished iPhone 12 Pro with poor voice quality and a depleted battery:

Title: Buyer Beware: Refurbished iPhone 12 Pro Falls Short

If you're in the market for a refurbished iPhone 12 Pro, proceed with caution with the units gor sale here. My recent experience with a supposedly "certified" refurbished unit from a third-party seller has been nothing short of disappointing.

Let's start with the voice quality. Despite being touted as "like new," the voice quality during calls is abysmal. Voices sound muffled, and there's a constant static noise that makes conversations a struggle. In an age where crystal-clear audio is expected, this issue is simply unacceptable.

But the problems don't stop there. The battery life on this refurbished unit is a joke. After a mere few hours of moderate use, the battery drains alarmingly fast, leaving you tethered to a power source. And to make matters worse, the battery health has already depleted to a dismal 88% – a far cry from the promised "like new" condition.

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this purchase is the lack of warranty coverage. Since the Apple warranty has expired, any issues that arise will be solely the responsibility of the new owner. That means costly repairs or replacement expenses down the line, effectively negating any potential savings from buying a refurbished device.

In conclusion, while the allure of a discounted refurbished iPhone 12 Pro is understandable, this particular unit fails to deliver on its promises. Poor voice quality, abysmal battery life, and the lack of warranty protection make this a purchase I cannot recommend. Unless you're willing to take a significant gamble, it's best to steer clear of this particular offering and explore alternative options.
