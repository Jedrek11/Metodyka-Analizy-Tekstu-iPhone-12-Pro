Its an overall great phone no real issues cosmetically a few nicks but not too noticeable. The only reason im not giving 5 stars is because the battery health is only at 78%. Not terrible but honestly feel like battery replacement should just be a given when you refurbish a phone. Other than that im happy with my purchase and is surprisingly a big upgrade from the 12 mini that i had previously.
