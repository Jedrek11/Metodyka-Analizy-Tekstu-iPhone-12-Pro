I upgraded to this iPhone 12 from an iPhone X, so it’s been a big step up in performance and features. I wanted to wait a couple of months before leaving a review to give a fair assessment. When the phone arrived, it was in good shape with no major damage or scratches to the screen. The display wasn’t original, but it was properly programmed to enable True Tone. I did notice a little screen discoloration right away, but nothing deal-breaking.
Performance has been solid overall. Recently, I’ve noticed the volume sometimes drops randomly when watching TikTok or Instagram videos, then suddenly jumps back to max when leaving the comments section. From what I’ve read, this seems to be a common iPhone 12 issue and not the seller’s fault. The phone also heats up quite a bit while charging, so I wouldn’t recommend heavy use (like FaceTime) when it’s plugged in.
Functionally, it’s reliable. I did drop it and crack the screen that part is on me but I’m glad I got Asurion insurance. I strongly recommend insurance for peace of mind. Overall, this iPhone 12 works great and was a clear upgrade from my iPhone X. Just be aware of the heating and possible non-original display if buying refurbished.
