My husband bought this phone for me! Everything works fine except i can only talk on the phone if it’s on speaker or hooked up to my headphones! Which is annoying when I’m in the grocery store with my 3 kids and i get a call and have to dig for headphones on talk on speaker phone in the deli! But the seller refunded 10% for my inconvenience because i didn’t want the hassle of sending it back! Besides that! Perfect Phone!
