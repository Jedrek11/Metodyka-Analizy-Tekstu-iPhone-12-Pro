My mom's iPhone 12 Pro still going strong after 3 years! The camera's incredible, battery life holds up well, and the screen's amazing. Durable design withstood many accidental drops. Minor battery drain over time, but overall, it's been a perfect blend of style, functionality, and ease of use for her.
