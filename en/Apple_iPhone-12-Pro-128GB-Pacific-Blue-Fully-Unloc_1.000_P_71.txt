Unless your universe is comprised of Android guess what you’re getting? An Apple iPhone. Works great. Definitely premium condition. Not much else you can say. If you wanted a Samsung phone you shoulda bought something else. The only small, very small complaint is the ‘color’. The frame, perimeter of the phone is ‘gold’. The absolute ugliest gold you’ll ever see. Kinda like a chrome finish. Think about those plastic kid’s phones you used to buy at Kmart. Get yourself a case and you’ll be fine. Sidenote: Talktek (the seller) is highly recommended. Very quick delivery. Great service.
