I ordered 2 of these phones. One for my fiancé and one for myself. My fiancés phone is still working for him but my phone only lasted for 8 months. It randomly shut off one day and wouldn’t turn back on and after taking to the Apple Store, I found out the phone was completely done and there was nothing they could do about it especially since I bought it off Amazon. It’s a gamble you take buying phones on Amazon and before that happened the phone definitely worked as needed and was a great phone overall. My fiancé still has his and it’s still doing what it needs to for him so he was lucky!
