Phone had a couple of very minor scratches (one barely noticeable on the screen and small scratches on the upper edge near the glass). Otherwise, in great shape. The battery gets hot when charging to where it needs to “cool down”. Battery came at 81% max health, so it definitely needs replacing. The phone is worth it, so I will get it replaced when I can. Phone works as it should and updated to iOS 18.5 with no issues. Seller shipped very quickly and it was received priority next day, so it came before noon. Pretty happy overall. Phone was also unlocked as advertised. I ordered the phone in graphite. It looks pretty good and has a heaviness to it that makes it feel premium. It feels sturdy and well-built. The screen was protected during shipping along with the back cameras, which is nice. The phone was protected overall during shipping and came with a charging cord and adapter (both off-brand), but work nonetheless. Will definitely get a new battery, but the phone looks great with no scratches on the back and just the very minor ones (can be hidden with case and screen protector). Thank you!
