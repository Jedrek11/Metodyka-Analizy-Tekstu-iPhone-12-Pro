Shipping was super fast considering it showed it came from Texas. When I got the iPhone 12 Pro:
-I noticed air bubbles were visible from the rear glass as if they did not do something right therefore bubbles were introduced.
- The generic cable that came with it didn’t not work at all, I had to run to my actual charger to see if the phone actually charger.
- The battery state of charge as shown through the iPhone diagnostics, shows the battery is at 79% and recommend replacing the battery.
- I made a phone call, and with the ear speaker volume as high as it can go, you could barely hear the other person on the other line.

Price wise, it was ok, body is ok, camera is fine, the iPhone works as intended. I did need a newer phone and I jump on the wagon and settled for this. But should I return it?
