We are aware it is a refurbished phone but we have had battery issues, issues with it just randomly restarting, the flashlight doesn’t work, the back cameras don’t work. We have tried to reach out to Amazon to use supposed 1 year warranty and they told us to contact Apple. So we went to an Apple center to talk to them and they told us they can’t do anything we have to go through Amazon. Honestly not happy with the price we paid and for there to be so many issues and not be able to get them resolved!
