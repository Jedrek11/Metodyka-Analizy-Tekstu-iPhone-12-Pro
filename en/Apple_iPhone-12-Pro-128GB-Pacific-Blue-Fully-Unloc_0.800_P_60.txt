I did receive my item very quickly,I did have issues with it when I first bought it. I had difficulty hearing when I received or tried to call someone using the phone. I did . contact customer support. They sent a link for me to contact Apple as they were the manufacture. Apple did set me up with an appointment to have it checked out. They did fix the sound issue but also told me I had faulty microphone.. so evidently everything is not exactly checked out to make it like new when you buy a renewed phone. This was the second 12 Pro that I bought through Amazon Amazon. The first one I sent right back.. On that note, I do like the phone. I think I will try out my phone for a bit to see if I have any more issues before I see if I need to send it back , it does have a warranty . I did buy an OtterBox case for it which I like really well.. I hope this helps anyone that is looking for a phone.
