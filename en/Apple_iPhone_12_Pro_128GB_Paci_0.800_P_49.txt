I got the iPhone 12 Pro with Amazon’s “renewed - premium” option. The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.

My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.

Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.

Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.

Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.

Hope this helps!
