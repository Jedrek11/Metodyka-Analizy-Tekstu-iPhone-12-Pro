I gave a Five Star Review because the small issue I’m having, may be my fault and not right , if I blamed the phone or the seller.

For some reason , the gps turns on and keeps telling me which way and how long, to get home ,

Without me requesting it.

Again ,
It may be my fault and not the phones fault because of something I selected during set up. But it’s not a big deal to ME !
