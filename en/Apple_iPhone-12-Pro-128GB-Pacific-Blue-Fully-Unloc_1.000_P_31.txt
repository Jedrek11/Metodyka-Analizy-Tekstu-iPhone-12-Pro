Product ordered late afternoon one day, arrived mid morning the next.
Phone was exactly as described.
Only minor issue was, after phone was updated with latest iOS, the setting gave a notification saying 'display issue.' Most likely due to screen replacement with a non-Apple screen. No biggie; aftermarket is most likely just as good. I'm not sharp enough to tell a difference.
