I initially purchased a refurbished phone from Walmart, expecting it to be like new. However, when I opened it up, I discovered deep scratches on the screen, making it almost impossible to see. The number of scratches on the screen bothered me, especially since the listing had described it as “like new.”

Frustrated, I decided to buy a refurbished phone from Amazon. I opted for the premium refurbished one, which appeared brand new. Surprisingly, the battery life was 100%, and it was an inexpensive backup phone. I highly recommend this refurbished phone to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable backup device.
