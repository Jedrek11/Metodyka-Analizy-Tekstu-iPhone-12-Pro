Works great! I bought it for my mom as an upgrade from her iPhone 8 and obviously it’s going to be better. Its battery life isn’t completely there but 80% was better than 69 my mom was rocking with. Camera is great. Only had a few minor dings on the overall body of the phone. The charger is comes with is kinda crap but my mom still had an iPhone charger so it’s fine. For 350 bucks,,, pretty good 🙂‍↕️
