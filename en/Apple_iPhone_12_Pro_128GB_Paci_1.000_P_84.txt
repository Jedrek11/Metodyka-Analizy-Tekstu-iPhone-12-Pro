The iPhone 12 Pro Max continues to impress! The display is sharp and vibrant, the performance is super smooth, and the camera quality is top-notch—even in low light. Battery life easily gets me through a full day, and the build feels premium and solid. It’s fast, reliable, and looks great too. Even in 2025, this phone holds up like a champ. Highly recommended if you’re looking for performance without jumping to the very latest model.
